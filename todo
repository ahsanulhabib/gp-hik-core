[current crashs / bugs]
- fix crash if labels +1 and -1 (instead of +1 and 0 ) are given
- fix crash when balanced learning is activated in a binary scenario
- fix crash when optimize noise is activated in binary scenario without DHS
- allow to add a new class when current setting is binary (i.e., we need to add two alpha vecs instead of one)

[nice to have]

- separate verbose-flags (optimization, training, classification, ...) needed?

- tutorials, numbers, demo-programs, ...

- consistency checks (dimensions etc.)

- more documentation (e.g., train of GPHIKClassifierNice train methods - what is binLabels)
