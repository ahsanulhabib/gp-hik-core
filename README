This code requires the NICE-core library (available on github) and implements the ideas presented in the following papers:

Alexander Freytag and Erik Rodner and Paul Bodesheim and Joachim Denzler
"Rapid Uncertainty Computation with Gaussian Processes and Histogram Intersection Kernels"
Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV). 2012.

Erik Rodner and Alexander Freytag and Paul Bodesheim and Joachim Denzler
"Large-Scale Gaussian Process Classification with Flexible Adaptive Histogram Kernels"
European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV). 2012. pages 85--98

If you use this software in your research, you have to cite at least one of the two papers.

Problems, questions, and general feedback should be addressed to:
